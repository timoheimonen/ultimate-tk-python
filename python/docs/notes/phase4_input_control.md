# Phase 4: Input and Player Control (Started)

This phase introduces the first gameplay control loop for the Python port.

Implemented:

- Event model expansion in `python/src/ultimatetk/core/events.py`:
  - Added action press/release events.
  - Added direct weapon-select events.
  - Added explicit action enum for movement/turning/strafe/weapon cycle.
- Headless scripted input support:
  - Added `python/src/ultimatetk/core/input_script.py` for parsing scripted events.
  - Added CLI `--input-script` and backend scheduling so controls can be replayed in headless runs.
- Terminal keyboard backend support:
  - Added `python/src/ultimatetk/core/terminal_input.py` for terminal byte decoding and action mapping.
  - Added `TerminalPlatformBackend` and CLI `--platform terminal`.
  - Added key-repeat hold logic to synthesize action release events in TTY mode.
  - Added legacy keybind translation so player1 controls from `options.cfg` are used where terminal input can represent them.
- Player control logic in `python/src/ultimatetk/systems/player_control.py`:
  - Legacy-style rotation steps (`9` degrees per tick).
  - Legacy movement behavior for forward/backward, strafe modifier, and dedicated strafe keys.
  - Wall collision checks based on floor-vs-wall level blocks.
  - Weapon slot cycling and direct slot selection.
  - Camera follow behavior adapted from legacy `Player::move_scr`.
- Gameplay integration in `python/src/ultimatetk/systems/gameplay_scene.py`:
  - Event handling now updates held input actions.
  - Player state is updated each simulation tick from held actions.
  - Camera follows the player and aiming direction.
  - Runtime metadata now includes player position, angle, and weapon slot.

Visual baseline updates:

- Gameplay scene now draws a player sprite frame from `RAMBO2.EFP` based on current view angle.
- Gameplay scene also renders a translucent aim marker (`TARGET.EFP`) at player look direction.

Verification:

- Added unit tests:
  - `python/tests/unit/test_app_platform_selection.py`
  - `python/tests/unit/test_events.py`
  - `python/tests/unit/test_terminal_input.py`
  - `python/tests/unit/test_input_script.py`
  - `python/tests/unit/test_headless_platform_input.py`
  - `python/tests/unit/test_player_control.py`
- Added integration test:
  - `python/tests/integration/test_headless_input_script_runtime.py`

Remaining work for Phase 4:

- Extend player interaction logic (shoot/load cadence and state transitions).
- Continue parity tuning for collision feel and camera response.
